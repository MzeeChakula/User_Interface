# Graph-Enhanced LLMs for Locally Sourced Elderly Nutrition Planning in Uganda

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered nutrition planning system specifically designed for elderly care in Uganda, combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with graph-based reasoning to provide culturally relevant and locally sourced meal recommendations.

## Abstract

The methodology begins with the creation and curation of a specialized dataset, integrating:

### Data Sources:
- **Published literature on geriatric nutrition** covering macro- and micronutrient needs for aging populations:
  - Protein for muscle preservation
  - Calcium and vitamin D for bone health
  - Iron and folate for anemia prevention
  - Omega-3 fatty acids for cardiovascular function

- **Regional food composition tables and agricultural surveys** documenting nutritional profiles of locally available foods:
  - Beans, groundnuts, millet
  - Matooke, sweet potatoes
  - Leafy greens, small fish
  - Local fruits

### Knowledge Graph Structure:
The system creates structured connections linking:
**Nutrients ↔ Health Benefits ↔ Elderly Conditions ↔ Local Food Items**

This enables structured reasoning over food–nutrient–condition pathways for conditions such as:
- Diabetes
- Hypertension  
- Frailty

### LLM Integration:
The LLM will be fine-tuned on this corpus and augmented with the knowledge graph to:
- Generate personalized meal plans based on individual's age, dietary restrictions, and health conditions
- Recommend culturally relevant, balanced, and affordable meals
- Incorporate graph constraints to avoid harmful food–condition interactions
- Provide weekly meal schedules, portion guidelines, and substitution options
- Include explanatory notes for caregivers

### Technical Requirements:
- **Mobile and offline-first deployment** for resource-constrained environments
- **Privacy-preserving design**
- **Caregiver-friendly interfaces** in local languages
- **Seasonality and local availability** considerations

### Evaluation Metrics:
1. **Accuracy** of nutrient-to-food mappings against dietician-verified gold standards
2. **Relevance and affordability** of generated plans for Ugandan households
3. **Acceptability and usability** among elderly caregivers
4. **Health outcome proxies** such as improved dietary diversity scores

## Project Goals:
By combining LLM-based generation, graph reasoning, and local food knowledge, this project delivers an inclusive and sustainable solution to enhance elderly nutritional health and home-based care in African contexts.
